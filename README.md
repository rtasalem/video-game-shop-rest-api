# RESTful API for a Video Game Shop ðŸŽ®
A basic RESTful API I built during a demo & tutorial for IT consultants at FDM Group with various backgrounds in TechOps, data engineering, and cloud engineering. The API utilises CRUD operations to add, retrieve, update, and delete video games from a H2 (in-memory) database.
